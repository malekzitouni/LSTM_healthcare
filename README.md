# 🚀 Transforming Healthcare with LSTM Networks: A Deep Dive into Patient Mortality Prediction

I’m thrilled to share my latest project: "Deploying Bidirectional LSTMs in Healthcare: Patient Mortality Prediction Using LSTM." This work highlights the power of AI in revolutionizing patient care through predictive analytics.

# 🔍 Project Highlights:

Developed an LSTM-based model to analyze Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and predict ICU mortality with high accuracy.

Addressed challenges like irregular time-series data and variable-length patient stays using advanced deep learning techniques.

Outperformed traditional clinical scoring systems (PRISM3, PIM2) with an AUC of 0.934, proving the value of AI in critical care.

Enabled real-time risk assessment, giving clinicians dynamic insights into patient outcomes.

# 📊 Why It Matters:

LSTMs unlock temporal patterns in medical data, improving early detection of life-threatening conditions.

The model integrates multimodal data (labs, vitals, medications), showcasing adaptability for real-world healthcare challenges.
